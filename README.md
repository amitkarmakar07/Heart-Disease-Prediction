# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes and predicts heart disease based on a dataset of health metrics. The project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning to build predictive models.

## Project Overview
The goal is to use patient data to predict the likelihood of developing heart disease within ten years. This can provide valuable insights for preventative healthcare measures.

## Features in the Dataset
Demographic Information: Age, gender, education level, etc.
Health Metrics:
Smoking habits (current smoker, cigarettes per day)
Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic)
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Heart rate, cholesterol levels, glucose levels
Health Conditions: Prevalent stroke, prevalent hypertension, diabetes
Target Variable: TenYearCHD (coronary heart disease within 10 years)

## Notebook Structure
1. Data Import and Exploration:
Load and preview the dataset.
Summarize key metrics like data shape and missing values.
2. Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values and drop irrelevant features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
4. Feature Engineering:
Select and transform features for modeling.
5. Model Building:
Train machine learning models to predict heart disease risk.
6. Evaluation:
Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.
